# Financial Sentiment Analysis

This is an academic project based on Machine Learning. The objective of the project is to analyse a financial statement and assign a sentiment label to it.
    
This is a 3-class classification task which is related to the domain of Natural Language Processing(NLP). There are three types of sentiments that can be associated with a statement: `positive`, `negative`, `neutral`.
