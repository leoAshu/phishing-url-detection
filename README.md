# Phishing URL Detection

The objective of the project is to analyse a web url and identify it as a legitimate or a phishing url.

At its core, this is a 2-class classification problem. The project uses data mining and machine learning techniques to address the problem of flagging a given url as phishing or legitimate.


## Data:
- Source: [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/72ptz43s9v/1)
- A CSV file that contains **88647** datapoints consisting of both legitimate and malicious websites.
- Each url is represented using **111** features based on which a url is labeled as phishing url or not.
- The dataset is fairly unbalanced with the number of legitimate urls roughly double the number of malicious urls.
